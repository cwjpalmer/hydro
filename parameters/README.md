1) Modify ino.ini file from /hydro/parameters by determining your serial port path.
2) Drop into /etc/ino.ini or ~/.inorc.
3) This way, whenever 'ino build' is run, it will default to mega2560 with proper serial port path.
4) If you are playing with borrowed Uno, just run ino build -m uno to force an Uno build but with same serial port. 
5) Have fun!
